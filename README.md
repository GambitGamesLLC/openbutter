# 🧈 OpenButter

> *The only thing better than one AI agent is a whole team of them — and a big pat of butter to smooth things out.*

OpenButter is the friendly face for your [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) AI orchestrators. No terminals. No cryptic commands. Just you, your AI team, and a big text box where you tell them what to do.

## What Is This?

Imagine ChatGPT, but instead of talking to a single AI, you're talking to **your** AI team — Chip, Cookie, and any other orchestrators you've set up. They handle the heavy lifting (spawning sub-agents, managing tasks, tracking costs). You just tell them what you want.

It's like having a really smart, really fast team that never sleeps — and OpenButter is the lobby where you check in.

## Why "Butter"?

Because:
1. Lobsters go with butter 🦞🧈
2. Butter makes everything better
3. It's silly and memorable
4. You try finding a good, available name in 2025

Plus, "OpenButter" sounds like it should be a real thing, right? Well, now it is.

## Quick Start

1. **Install OpenClaw** (if you haven't): <https://openclaw.ai/>
2. **Clone this repo** somewhere
3. **Open `index.html`** in your browser (seriously, that's it)
4. **Start chatting** with your orchestrators

## Features

- 🎯 **Simple Chat Interface** — Like every chat app you already know
- 👥 **Orchestrator Sidebar** — See your AI team at a glance
- 📝 **Truth Management** — Define what your agents should work toward
- 💰 **Cost Tracking** — Watch your token spend (so you don't cry later)
- 🎨 **Light & Dark Themes** — Because we care about your eyes

## Philosophy

- **Zero build steps** — It's just HTML, JS, and CSS
- **OpenClaw-native** — Built on OpenClaw standards, not generic APIs
- **Human-first** — You talk to orchestrators, they handle the rest
- **Silly but serious** — Fun name, solid engineering

## Tech Stack

- **Vanilla JS** — No frameworks, no build tools, no nonsense
- **Web Components** — Modern, encapsulated, reusable
- **JSDoc** — Type hints without TypeScript overhead
- **TDD** — Tests first, code second, bugs never

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/derrickbarra/openbutter.git
cd openbutter
# Open index.html in your browser
# Or run a local server:
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
